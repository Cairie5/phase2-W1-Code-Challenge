# Bank Transactions Web App

This is a React web application that allows users to view, add, and delete bank transactions. It fetches transaction data from a local server running JSON Server and displays it in a table. Users can search for transactions by description, sort transactions alphabetically by category or description, and delete transactions from the table. Additionally, the app includes an "Undo" feature that allows users to restore recently deleted transactions back to the table.

## Features

- View a table of all transactions
- Add new transactions to the table (local only, not persisted to the backend)
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar
- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description
- Delete transactions, with the ability to undo the deletion
